# Coding Challenge: Strangler Approach & Refactoring

## Problem Statement
You are working on migrating a legacy monolith application to microservices using the Strangler Approach. The existing monolith has a method that calculates energy costs, and it needs to be refactored into a new microservice.

## Task
- Refactor the code to follow the Open/Closed Principle by eliminating the hardcoded region checks.
- Design a microservice (just the class structure) that can support future regional rate updates without modifying existing logic.
- Write a simple integration test for your new microservice.

```
public class EnergyCostCalculator {
    public double calculateCost(double consumption, String region) {
        double rate;
        if (region.equals("US")) {
            rate = 0.12;
        } else if (region.equals("EU")) {
            rate = 0.15;
        } else if (region.equals("APAC")) {
            rate = 0.10;
        } else {
            rate = 0.20; // Default rate
        }
        return consumption * rate;
    }
}
```
